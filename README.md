# Code examples

Here are a couple code examples that may be useful.

In each file, you'll see many comments describing what each part does.
Comments look like this:

```html 
<!-- This is an HTML comment -->
```

```js 
// This is a Javascript comment
```

Feel free to copy the code and use it for your own projects.
