<!-- This uses some fancy math and number manipulation to create a color code that looks like this: #19ab15 -->
<!-- Your computer reads codes like that to figure out which color to display -->
<button onclick = "text.style.color = '#' + (0x1000000 + Math.random() * 0xffffff).toString(16).substr(1, 6);">Change the color</button>
<p id = "text">Color changing text!</p>
